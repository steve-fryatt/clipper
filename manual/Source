<chapter title="Introduction" file="Intro">

The global clipboard provides a way of transferring data between applications. You select the data in one application and cut or copy it onto the clipboard (usually using <key>Ctrl-X</key> and <key>Ctrl-C</key>). You then move to the other application and paste the data from the clipboard (usually <key>Ctrl-V</key>).

<cite>Clipper</cite> allows you to save the current contents of the global clipboard, either to disc or to another application. You can also drag files from a filer window to <cite>Clipper</cite> to put that file on the clipboard, and type the clipboard contents to the caret.

The <cite>IcnClipBrd</cite> module, which allows you to cut and paste in writeable icons using the global clipboard, is no longer supplied with <cite>Clipper</cite>, but is available from <link ref="http://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/clipboard">http://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/clipboard</link>.

The <cite>Clipper</cite> utility was originally called <cite>Clipboard</cite> and written, along with the <cite>IcnClipBrd</cite> module, by Thomas Leonard. It was converted to 32-bit for use on RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;5 by myself (Stephen Fryatt), and was renamed <cite>Clipper</cite> in 2020 to resolve a clash with a legitimately-allocated application name. I would like to thank Thomas for allowing his code to be placed in the Public Domain; any problems encountered using the updated application and module are likely to be my fault and should be reported first to the address below.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Installation" file="Install">

To use <cite>Clipper</cite>, simply run it from a Filer window. If you always want it on the iconbar, it can be included in the list of applications to be run at startup in the <icon>Boot</icon> section of Configure.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Using Clipper" file="Use">

Once <cite>Clipper</cite> is loaded, it will install an icon on the iconbar. Click <mouse>select</mouse> on this icon to open the <window>Save clipboard</window> window. If there is anything on the clipboard then you will be able to drag the icon to a directory or to another application to save the clipboard. You can put a file onto the clipboard by dragging it to this window.

If you toggle the window size then you can see an extra box which indicates what <cite>Clipper</cite> is doing. This may be helpful for programmers trying to work out why their program doesn&rsquo;t work with <cite>Clipper</cite>. Note that the problem may well be <cite>Clipper</cite>&rsquo;s fault!

If there is text on the clipboard, an <mouse>adjust</mouse> click on the iconbar icon will type it at the caret. Only those characters which are considered to be either not control characters or white space will be included in the text; content including newlines and carriage returns might not have the expected effects.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Other information" file="Other">

<cite>Clipper</cite> was written by Thomas Leonard. The 32-bit conversion was done by Stephen Fryatt.

<list>
<li>Wrote most of <cite>IcnClipBrd</cite> including transfer of clipboard via <code>Wimp$Scrap</code> and sending using RAM transfer (but not yet receiving data this way).
</list>


<subhead title="Version 0.04 (23 October 1996)">

<list>

</list>


<subhead title="Version 0.05 (08 September 1998)">

<list>
<li>Made WimpSlot 36K, as someone said it wouldn't run on their computer with 32K. Changed the window layout to make the Owner box bigger.
